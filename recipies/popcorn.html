    <p>
      Simple homemade Cheddar popcorn can be made with just 3 ingredients.
      Unlike popcorn from a bag or tin, this is hot and fresh. I've been making
      this since I was a kid. It got me in trouble though, because I used to
      snag the packet from the boxed mac and cheese in the pantry. Thankfully,
      they sell the Cheddar powder on its own now.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3/4 cup popcorn</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place oil in a large stock pot over medium-high heat. Place 3 popcorn
        kernels in the pot. Cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait for all 3 kernels to pop. Add remaining popcorn kernels. Cover the
        pot with a lid and cook until two seconds go by and kernels are no
        longer popping, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer popped corn to a large bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Cheddar
        cheese powder over popcorn; toss. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon cheese
        powder over popcorn; toss again. Serve immediately.
